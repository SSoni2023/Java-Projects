Java Projects

This repository contains all Java programming assignments and the final project completed. 
Each piece demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, validation logic, menu-driven systems, and data handling using arrays and classes.

## Overview of Assessments

Assignment 1 â€“ Java Console Program**
File:** `GradingSystem.java`
Description: A simple console application that collects names, student IDs, and marks for 3 assessments, then calculates the grade (HD, D, C, P, F).
Key Features:
  - Input validation for empty names and invalid marks
  - Calculation of average, minimum, and maximum marks
  - Outputs student grades based on total score
**Concepts Used:** **Scanner input, primitive data types, conditionals, loops, and constants.**

Assignment 2 â€“ Menu-Driven Java Program (Array of Objects)**
Files:** `Student.java`, `GradingSystemMenu.java`
Description:** An enhancement of Assignment 1 using arrays of `Student` objects and a menu-driven interface.
Key Features:**
  - Menu options for adding, displaying, and processing records
  - Encapsulated data using classes with constructors, getters, and setters
  - Total mark and grade calculation methods inside the `Student` class
**Concepts Used:** OOP, arrays, methods, constructors, and input validation.

Final Project â€“ Extended Java Grading System**
Files:** `Project.java`, extended version of Assignment 2 classes
Description:** A feature-rich version of the grading system integrating:
Search functionality** by student name or ID
Sorting** of student records alphabetically (custom sort logic)
Three new features** added (examples):
    - Course/Unit Enrolment
    - Payment Status Tracking
    - Academic Progress Checker
Key Features:**
  - Clean menu UI
  - Linear search and custom sorting (no in-built sort)
  - Modular structure with new classes and methods
**Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming, advanced input handling, custom logic for sorting/search, modular design.**

Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- NetBeans IDE (for Assignment 2 & Project)
- Console-based UI
- No external libraries used
